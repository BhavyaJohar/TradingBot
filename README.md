# TradingBot
This project aims to create a trading bot that implements a high frequency trading strategy. Currently it trades SPY and uses a variety of technical indicators such as rolling averages, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands. The bot only trades during market hours due to liquidity. I'm going to continue to test different strategies and see which ones generate the greatest return. I'm also going to test which stocks are better for the bot. To start off, I chose the SPY ETF becuase of its high implied volatility. I predict that the bot will generate greater returns by trading securities that make bigger moves on a day to day basis.
